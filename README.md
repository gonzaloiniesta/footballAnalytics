# Football Analytics

Football Analytics is a personal project aimed at applying my skills in programming, data analysis, and system development. This project focuses on the statistical analysis of football matches.

The system collects data from various sources, stores it in a NoSQL database in JSON format, and utilizes a microservice API to perform different analyses. These analyses are delivered through HTTP endpoints, providing access to detailed statistics and advanced metrics.

Additionally, the project includes an interactive frontend that consumes the API, offering an intuitive and visually appealing user experience. Football Analytics combines technology and football, creating a platform to delve deeper into the analysis of this exciting sport.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gathers data from multiple sources.
- **NoSQL Database**: Stores data in MongoDB using JSON format for flexibility.
- **API Microservice**: Built with FastAPI, it delivers efficient and scalable endpoints.
- **Data Analysis**: Uses Pandas for advanced data manipulation and analysis.
- **Interactive Frontend**: (Future development) A dynamic UI using JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js to visualize the data.

## Technologies Used

- **API Framework**: Developed with FastAPI for high performance, ease of use, and automatic Swagger documentation generation.
- **API Contract**: Designed using Stoplight.
- **Data Storage**: MongoDB, a NoSQL database, efficiently manages JSON data.
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, a powerful Python library for data manipulation.
- **Frontend**: (Future implementation) Developed with JavaScript frameworks such as React or Vue.js to create interactive and user-friendly interfaces.
